          <h1>Briicks Terms of Service</h1>
          <p class="subtitle">Last updated: May 10, 2024</p>
        </header>
      
        <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the Briicks mobile application (the "Service") operated by Marcello De Palo ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
        <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>
        <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>
        <p><strong>Subscriptions</strong></p>
        <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
        <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Marcello De Palo cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Marcello De Palo customer support team.</p>
        <p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Marcello De Palo with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Marcello De Palo to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
        <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Marcello De Palo will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
        <p><strong>Free Trial</strong></p>
        <p>Marcello De Palo may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").</p>
        <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>
        <p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by Marcello De Palo until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>
        <p>At any time and without notice, Marcello De Palo reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>
        <p><strong>Fee Changes</strong></p>
        <p>Marcello De Palo, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
        <p>Marcello De Palo will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
        <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
        <p><strong>Refunds</strong></p>
        <p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>
        <p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p>
        <p>The Service and its original content, features and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Marcello De Palo and its licensors. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of Marcello De Palo</p>
        <p><strong>Links To Other Web Sites</strong></p>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Marcello De Palo</p>
        <p>Marcello De Palo has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that Marcello De Palo shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.</p>
        <p>We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party web sites or services that you visit.</p>
        <p><strong>Termination</strong></p>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>
        <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.</p>
        <p><strong>Limitation Of Liability</strong></p>
        <p>In no event shall Marcello De Palo, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>
        <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>
        <p>Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis.

        <p><strong>Governing Law</strong></p>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Italy, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
        <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>
        <p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
        <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.</p>
        <p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p>
        <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us.</p>
